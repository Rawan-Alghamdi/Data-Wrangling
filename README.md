# Data-Wrangling
This is the seventh project for Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Udacity

In this project, I experienced Data wrangling process which contains of three main steps, gathering , assessing and finally cleaning. I did all
these three steps then, I did some analysis to provide some insights of the data which is presented in details in other report “act_report”. The dataset that was used in this
project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
